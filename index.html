            <h1>Romeo and Juliet Original Play</h1>
            <h4><strong>Enter Nurse</strong></h4>
            <p><span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
                Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
                Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
                What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
                Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
                The County Paris hath set up his rest,
                That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
                Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
                I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
                Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
                He’ll fright you up, i’ faith. Will it not be?</span></p>
            <h4><strong>Undraws Curtain</strong></h4>
            <p><span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: What, dress’d! and in your clothes! and down again!
                I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
                Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady’s dead!
                O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
                Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!</span></p>
            <h4><strong>Enter Lady Capulet</strong></h4>
            <p><span data-actor="ladyCapulet">Lady Capulet: What noise is here?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: O lamentable day!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="ladyCapulet">Lady Capulet: What is the matter?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: Look, look! O heavy day!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="ladyCapulet">Lady Capulet: O me, O me! My child, my only life,
                Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
                Help, help! Call help.</span></p>
            <h4><strong>Enter Capulet</strong></h4>
            <p><span data-actor="capulet">Capulet: For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: She’s dead, deceased, she’s dead; alack the day!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="ladyCapulet">Lady Capulet: Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="capulet">Capulet: Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she’s cold:
                Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
                Life and these lips have long been separated:
                Death lies on her like an untimely frost
                Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: O lamentable day!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="ladyCapulet">Lady Capulet: O woful time!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="capulet">Capulet: Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,
                Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.</span></p>
            <h4><strong>Enter Friar Laurence and Paris, with Musicians</strong></h4>
            <p><span data-actor="friarLaurence">Friar Laurence: Come, is the bride ready to go to church?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="capulet">Capulet: Ready to go, but never to return.
                O son! the night before thy wedding-day
                Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
                Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
                Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
                My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
                And leave him all; life, living, all is Death’s.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="paris">Paris: Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,
                And doth it give me such a sight as this?</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="ladyCapulet">Lady Capulet: Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
                Most miserable hour that e’er time saw
                In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
                But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
                But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
                And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="nurse">Nurse: O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
                Most lamentable day, most woful day,
                That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
                O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
                Never was seen so black a day as this:
                O woful day, O woful day!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="paris">Paris: Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
                Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,
                By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
                O love! O life! not life, but love in death!</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="capulet">Capulet: Despised, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d!
                Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
                To murder, murder our solemnity?
                O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
                Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
                And with my child my joys are buried.</span></p>
            <p><span data-actor="friarLaurence">Friar Laurence: Peace, ho, for shame! confusion’s cure lives not
                In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
                Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
                And all the better is it for the maid:
                Your part in her you could not keep from death,
                But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
                The most you sought was her promotion;
                For ’twas your heaven she should be advanced:
                And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
                Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
                O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
                That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
                She’s not well married that lives married long;
                But she’s best married that dies married young.
                Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
                On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
                In all her best array bear her to church:
                For though fond nature bids us an lament,
                Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.</span></p>
